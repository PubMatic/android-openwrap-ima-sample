# Introduction
This is a reference application showing you how you can enable OpenWrap header bidding for an in-stream video ad in an Android app. The app will make the initial ad request to OpenWrap server which runs a cloud-side auction with bids received from Prebid S2S bidders. The client receives the winning bid from the OpenWrap server and then passes on the winning bid price to GAM (Google Ad Manager). If GAM finds a campaign of higher price, GAM returns and renders the video ad. Otherwise, OpenWrap's winning bid will be sent back to the client and be rendered using IMA video player.
